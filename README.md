# 📘 Tuberculosis X-Ray Prediction Using Deep Learning 

Welcome to the **Tuberculosis X-Ray Prediction Using Deep Learning** repository! This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`training.ipynb`) which demonstrates the process of training a machine learning model using Python and standard data science libraries.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

This notebook walks through the complete pipeline for a machine learning task. It includes:

- Loading and preprocessing data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation of model performance
- Saving or exporting the trained model for deployment

This project can serve as a starting point for students, beginners, or professionals looking to understand and implement basic machine learning workflows.
